<div class="tab-content active" id="tab1"><h2>Day 1- Introduction & Application</h2><p>On the first day, I was introduced to the concept of laser cutting. I learned what it is, how it works, and the types of lasers like CO₂, Fiber, and Diode. The session also explained where laser cutting is commonly used, such as in cutting wood, acrylic, paper, and cardboard. Safety rules were also discussed to ensure safe handling of the machine.</p>
<p>Key Points:</p>
<p>What is laser cutting?</p>
<p>Types of lasers: CO₂, Fiber, Diode</p>
<p>Applications in wood, acrylic, cardboard, etc.</p>
<p>Basic safety guidelines</p>
<p>✅ Activity: I looked around and listed 5 items that could be laser-cut (like acrylic keychains, wooden nameplates, cardboard models, decorative panels, and paper stencils).r</p></div>

<div class="tab-content" id="tab2">
  <h2>Day 2: Hardware & Software</h2>
  
  <p>This day focused on understanding the hardware components of a laser cutter such as the laser tube, working bed, exhaust, and air assist. Along with this, I learned about the LaserCAD software, which is used to prepare designs and send them to the machine. The difference between vector cutting and raster engraving was explained, along with supported file formats like .svg and .dxf.</p><p>Key Points:</p><p>Laser cutter parts: tube, bed, exhaust, air assist</p>
<p>Software used: LaserCAD</p><p>Vector vs Raster difference</p>
<p>File formats: .svg, .dxf</p><p>✅ Activity: I designed a simple circle and square in LaserCAD, saved it in the correct format, and prepared it for cutting.</p>

</div>

<div class="tab-content" id="tab3"><h2>Day 3: Design Basics</h2>
  
  <img src="laser2.jpg" width="200" height="200" align="right">
  <p>On the third day, I focused on designing for laser cutting. I learned how to set up files for cutting vs engraving and how to adjust settings accordingly. I was also introduced to press-fit design concepts, where parts are cut with precision to fit together without glue or screws.</p>
<p>Key Points:</p>
<p>Cut vs engrave setup</p>
<p>Press-fit design tips</p>
<p>Importance of precision in design</p><p>✅ Activity: I designed a small box with engraved text on its sides. This helped me understand how cutting and engraving can be combined in one project.</p></div>

<div class="tab-content" id="tab4"><h2>Day 4: Material & Settings</h2>
  <p>Different materials respond differently to a laser beam. On this day, I learned which materials can be cut (like wood, acrylic, cardboard, and paper) and which require careful handling. I practiced adjusting power and speed settings for clean cuts and accurate engravings. Running a test grid on a sample material was emphasized as a good practice before starting real projects.</p>
<p>Key Points:</p><p>Suitable materials: wood, acrylic, cardboard, paper</p><p>Power/speed adjustment</p><p>Importance of test grids</p><p>✅ Activity: I created a speed and power test grid on cardboard to find out which settings worked best for smooth cutting without burning.</p></div>

<div class="tab-content" id="tab5"><h2>Day 5: Operating the Laser</h2>
  <img src="laser3.jpg" width="200" height="200" align="right">
  <p>This day was about learning the practical steps of operating the laser cutter. I learned how to focus the laser, set up the working bed, and switch on the air assist and exhaust. Sending files from the computer to the machine and performing safety checks was also practiced. Finally, I cut my first real design.</p><p>Key Points:</p><p>focusing and bed alignment</p>
<p>Using air assist and exhaust</p>
<p>File transfer and job setup</p>
<p>Safety checks (emergency stop)</p>
<p>✅ Activity: I cut out my box design from Day 3 and checked the fitting of its parts.</p></div>

<div class="tab-content" id="tab6"><h2>Day 6: Project Day</h2>
  <img src="laser1.jpg" width="200" height="300" align="right">
  <p>This was a full hands-on project day. I chose to make a mobile stand using laser cutting. The process included preparing the file, arranging the shapes properly (nesting), cutting the parts, and then assembling them. I also documented each step with notes and pictures for future reference.</p><p>Key Points:
<p>Choosing and designing a product</p>
<p>File preparation and nesting</p>
<p>Cutting and assembling the parts</p>
<p>Documenting the process</p>
<p>✅ Activity: I completed my laser-cut mobile stand project, assembled it successfully, and wrote down the steps I followed.</p></div>

<div class="tab-content" id="tab7"><h2>Day 7: Review & Maintenance</h2>
  <p>The last day was about review and maintenance. I learned how to troubleshoot common problems like burn marks, incomplete cuts, and misalignment. I also practiced cleaning the machine, including the lens and mirrors, which is important for maintaining accuracy. The day ended with a project showcase, where I presented my work and reflected on my learning.</p><p>Key Points:
<p>Troubleshooting common issues</p>
<p>Basic maintenance: cleaning lens and mirrors</p>
<p>Presenting and reviewing projects</p>
<p>✅ Activity: I presented my Titanic boat project, explained the steps I took, and reflected on what I learned throughout the 7-day journey.</p></div>
